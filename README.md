## Explanation

## Nameservers
DNS middleman services hide the IP addresses of servers. Whilst originally designed as a cybersecurity measure, those providers see no problem with being an enabler of crime and refuse to take action even when the scam report is very easy to validate. The nameservers indirectly reveal who the DNS middleman is, as their DNS servers listed in the whois query can be mapped to the middleman:
| DNS server              | Real middleman                           |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| *.registrar-servers.com | [Namecheap](http://www.namecheap.com)    |
| *.ns.cloudflare.com     | [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) |
